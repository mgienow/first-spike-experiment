              <div id="aboutText">
                <p>All through childhood I MADE things. Early on, I sculpted food from clay for my dollhouse…the one that never housed dolls. The interior design of the rooms was what I loved: assembling tiny furniture kits, hanging miniature patterned wallpaper, staining and installing popsicle sticks as hardwood flooring, and even laying a floor of tiny “bricks” in the kitchen.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Majoring in architecture seemed inevitable. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Architecture from the University of Virginia and then a Master of Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania. While working for Alexander Design Studio, I designed a beach house in Delaware that won an American Institute of Architects award. That beach house design, however, began with several scaled models. In fact, all throughout architecture school, my favorite aspect of the design process was making models. The built environment…miniaturized.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Then came the day I needed a kitchen table. I wanted it to have a distinct personality, a piece with whimsy. This was the beginning of my refocusing on furniture design and fabrication after a ten-year career in architecture.</p>
                <br><p>Going full circle back to my days of miniatures: my latest furniture line, Furnished Furniture, incorporates miniature "rooms" floating within the full scale furniture framework.</p>
